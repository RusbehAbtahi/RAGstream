"""
SuperPrompt (v1) — central prompt object (manual __init__, no dataclass).
Place at: ragstream/orchestration/super_prompt.py

Notes (agreed pipeline choices; for reference only):
- Retrieval aggregation: LogAvgExp (length-normalized LogSumExp) with τ = 9 over per-piece cosine sims.
- Re-ranker: cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2 on (Prompt_MD, chunk_text).
