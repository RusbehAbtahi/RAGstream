# üìò Prompt Engineering Project ‚Äì Knowledge Map and Learning Priorities  
### Summary of Exploration with ChatGPT (April 2025)

---

## I. Core Structure ‚Äì The 8 Chapters of Advanced Prompt Engineering  
*("List A" developed collaboratively)*

### 1. Fundamental Prompt Structuring
- 1.1 Zero-shot vs. few-shot  
- 1.2 Role-based prompting & system messages  
- 1.3 Meta-prompts (prompts that create prompts)  
- 1.4 Basic chain-of-thought (CoT) usage  

### 2. Advanced Reasoning & Logic
- 2.1 Self-consistency prompting  
- 2.2 ReAct (Reason + Act) & tree-of-thought methods  
- 2.3 Multi-step reflection  
- 2.4 Program-aided prompting (e.g., reasoning with tools)  

### 3. Orchestration & Tool Integration
- 3.1 LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom pipelines  
- 3.2 Multi-agent collaboration (planner + executor)  
- 3.3 Toolformer / function calling  
- 3.4 Reranking & filtering (comparing multiple generations)  

### 4. Context & Retrieval Augmentation
- 4.1 Document retrieval (vector embeddings)  
- 4.2 Summaries or chunked context  
- 4.3 Domain knowledge injection  
- 4.4 Relevance scoring & bridging content  

### 5. Personalization & Customization
- 5.1 Fine-tuning smaller models for rewriting  
- 5.2 Prompt rewriting using user profiles  
- 5.3 Feedback-based or preference-based tuning (e.g., RLHF, DPO)  
- 5.4 Prompt caching / dynamic personalization  

### 6. Evaluation & Reliability
- 6.1 Prompt sensitivity analysis & A/B testing  
- 6.2 Token efficiency & cost analysis  
- 6.3 Adversarial prompt testing  
- 6.4 Safety & alignment strategies  

### 7. Automation & Prompt Tuning
- 7.1 AutoPrompting (genetic/evolutionary prompt generation)  
- 7.2 Learned prompts (soft / prefix tuning)  
- 7.3 Reinforcement learning for prompt optimization  
- 7.4 Large-scale prompt management (versioning, CI/CD for prompts)  

### 8. Domain-Specific Extensions
- 8.1 Code generation and debugging  
- 8.2 Legal or policy-based prompting  
- 8.3 Medical or scientific prompting  
- 8.4 Multimodal prompting (text + image input)

## II. ‚úÖ My Core Highlighted Topics  
*These are my top-priority learning goals, saved for deeper focus and application.*

- ‚úÖ 3.1 LangChain, LlamaIndex, or Custom Pipelines  
- ‚úÖ 4.1 Document Retrieval (Vector Embeddings)  
- ‚úÖ 5.1 Fine-tuning Smaller Models for Rewriting  
- ‚úÖ 5.3 Feedback-based or Preference-based Tuning (esp. RLHF and DPO)  
- ‚úÖ 5.4 Prompt Caching / Dynamic Personalization  
- ‚úÖ 7.2 Learned Prompts (Soft / Prefix Tuning)  
- ‚úÖ 7.3 Reinforcement Learning for Prompt Optimization

## III. üîπ Weak (But Still Valuable) Highlights  
*These are useful techniques that may be revisited later or when scaling up.*

- üîπ 4.4 Relevance Scoring & Bridging Content  
- üîπ 5.2 Prompt Rewriting Using User Profiles  
- üîπ 6.3 Adversarial Prompt Testing

## IV. üß† Inferred Interests from Behavior and Reactions

- **Prompt Evolution over Time**  
  Your deep exploration of 7.3 and 6.1 shows a clear interest in adaptive systems that self-improve prompt effectiveness.

- **Model-Prompt Compatibility**  
  Your analysis of GPT-4o vs GPT-4-turbo suggests a concern for prompt tuning per model architecture ‚Äî an advanced skill.

- **Manual + Scripted Hybrid Workflows**  
  You seem to favor workflows where a human provides insight first, followed by automated or Python-based execution ‚Äî especially relevant to your engineering background.

- **Prompt Workspace Strategies**  
  Your comparison of ‚ÄúPlan A‚Äù (LangChain) vs ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù (ChatGPT as Prompt Hub) shows a reflective, strategic mindset around tool integration and memory.

---

## ‚úÖ Final Note

You‚Äôve already internalized many techniques from Sections 1, 2, and 8.  
Your current priority zones ‚Äî **Sections 3, 4, 5, and 7** ‚Äî strongly align with your goal of building a **personalized, agent-driven, document-aware AI assistant system**.

You're not starting from zero ‚Äî you're scaling from insight to system design.
