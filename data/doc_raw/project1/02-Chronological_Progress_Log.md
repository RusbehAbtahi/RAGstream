## 2025

### Professional Pivot & Technical Transformation <a name="2025"></a>

#### Q1 · Transition & Goal Setting <a name="2025-q1"></a>

- **Jan 2025** • BMW Motorrad project ended → initiated full-time skill-upgrade plan  
  – Targets: Python mastery, AWS/cloud engineering, prompt-engineering leadership  
  – Defined management-skill growth & income goals

- **Feb – Mar 2025** • Launched structured AWS study (IAM, S3, Lambda, cost control)  
  – Established meta-learning workflow (Te execution → Ti conceptualization)  
  – Drafted TinyLlama cloud-inference vision and Prompt-Engineering roadmap

#### Q2 · AWS & Prompt-Engineering Deep Dive <a name="2025-q2"></a>

- **Apr 2025** • First Docker-based Lambda deployed (OpenAI planner → S3)  
  – Authored **12-AWS-Conceptual_Map** documenting IAM & cost-guardrails  
  – Built first RAG pipeline (LlamaIndex) and cognitive management guides

- **May 2025** • Lambda Orchestration MVP achieved  
  – CI/CD with CodeBuild, scripted deployment, cost watchdog  
  – Technical audits: **13-Lambda_OpenAI_Audit**, **Bootstrap_MVP.md**  
  – Designed EC2 GPU hibernation architecture (**16-Personal_TinyLlama_Cloud_Architecture.md**)  
  – Formalized 8-mode MBTI management framework

#### May – Jul 2025 · MVP Delivery, Lambda, API, SSM, Infra Integration <a name="2025-may-jul"></a>

- **Jun–Jul 2025** • **Lambda Router Deployment (LAM-001):**  
  – TinyLlama Lambda Router deployed via Terraform, with JWT authentication and Pydantic schema validation.  
  – Automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions) and id-token trust integration.  
  – Key blockers resolved: `/ping` route conflict (switched to `/health`), source code redeploy issues (fixed via `source_code_hash`), and IAM permission debugging.
- **Jun–Jul 2025** • **API JWT Auth & Infra:**  
  – Full JWT-based authorization for `/infer`.  
  – All code dependencies and environments fully synchronized via `.env.dev`.  
  – Networking baseline established: S3 + DynamoDB state, custom VPC, subnets, IGW/NAT.
- **Jul 2025** • **SSM Registry v2:**  
  – All environment-specific AWS IDs/ARNs now written/read from SSM Parameter Store for safety and automation.
- **Lessons:**  
  – Never use AWS-reserved `/ping` as route.  
  – Always use least-privilege IAM and sync env vars.
- **Next (Q3 2025):**  
  – **SQS job queue phase**: EC2 automation, multi-agent, GUI/UX, governance, and CI/CD enhancement.

## Ongoing · Skill Development & Vision <a name="ongoing"></a>

- All Lambda/API/Infra/SSM tickets merged and validated (July 2025).
- Focus now on SQS integration, EC2 lifecycle automation, multi-agent architecture, and dynamic prompt routing.

---

## Update Protocol <a name="update-protocol"></a>

1. **Append** new milestones in chronological order (YYYY-MM-DD).  
2. Keep bullet points brief; add short narrative only for major learning phases.  
3. Link related `.md` files when a milestone produces new documentation.  
4. Review quarterly for clarity; archive superseded detail elsewhere.
