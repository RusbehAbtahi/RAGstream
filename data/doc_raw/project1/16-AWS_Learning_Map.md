# 📘 AWS Project – Knowledge Map and Learning Priorities  
### Summary of Exploration with ChatGPT (June 2025)

---

## I. Core Structure – The 8 Domains of Modern AWS Practice  
*(Structured in collaboration with ChatGPT & reference files)*

### 1. Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- 1.1 IAM users, groups, and policies  
- 1.2 Roles, trust vs permission policies  
- 1.3 Managed, inline, and boundary policies  
- 1.4 MFA, root user best practices  
- 1.5 Temporary credentials & STS  
- 1.6 IAM Access Analyzer, policy validation  

### 2. Compute & Containerization
- 2.1 Lambda (function deployment & triggers)  
- 2.2 EC2 (provisioning, lifecycle, cleanup)  
- 2.3 ECR (container image registry)  
- 2.4 Docker in AWS context  
- 2.5 GPU/CPU quota management  
- 2.6 Autoscaling basics (meta-learning only)  

### 3. Storage & Data Management
- 3.1 S3 bucket management (versioning, permissions)  
- 3.2 Object lifecycle, cost controls  
- 3.3 Secrets Manager usage  
- 3.4 Data input/output pipelines  

### 4. DevOps & CI/CD
- 4.1 CodeBuild (build, package, deploy)  
- 4.2 CodeStar/Connections (GitHub linking)  
- 4.3 Buildspec & artifact handling  
- 4.4 Pipeline architecture (manual + planned automation)  
- 4.5 CloudWatch log review  

### 5. Networking & API Integration
- 5.1 API Gateway (endpoint setup & integration)  
- 5.2 Lambda routing, permissions  
- 5.3 Security groups (EC2)  
- 5.4 Public/private IPs, keypair management  
- 5.5 VPC basics (default config; advanced planned)  

### 6. Security & Cost Management
- 6.1 Budgeting & cost alerts  
- 6.2 Resource cleanup automation  
- 6.3 Least privilege enforcement  
- 6.4 Monitoring, alarms, and error tracking  

### 7. Infrastructure as Code & Automation
- 7.1 Bash scripting for deployment & teardown  
- 7.2 Python/boto3 orchestration  
- 7.3 (Planned) CDK/Terraform introduction  
- 7.4 Automation patterns, idempotency, tagging  

### 8. Meta-Learning & Self-Documentation
- 8.1 Architectural mapping (roadmaps, causality tables)  
- 8.2 AWS docs/meta summaries  
- 8.3 Debugging and “learn by doing”  
- 8.4 Personal knowledge base maintenance

## II. ✅ My Core Highlighted Topics  
*These are top-priority skills and learning goals for deeper focus and mastery.*

- ✅ 1.2 Roles, trust vs permission policies (hands-on & meta)  
- ✅ 2.1 Lambda–ECR integration (containers)  
- ✅ 3.1 S3 and Secrets Manager for project state  
- ✅ 4.1–4.3 CodeBuild & GitHub flows (toward full CI/CD)  
- ✅ 6.1–6.3 Cost controls, cleanup, least-privilege IAM  
- ✅ 7.2 Python-based orchestration (boto3, scripting)  
- ✅ 8.1–8.2 Mapping, meta-learning, and architecture docs

## III. 🔹 Weak (But Still Valuable) Highlights  
*Techniques/areas useful for future scaling and specialization.*

- 🔹 2.5 GPU quota management (infrastructure planning)  
- 🔹 5.5 Advanced VPC/networking (not yet hands-on)  
- 🔹 7.3–7.4 IaC (CDK, Terraform, tagging standards)  
- 🔹 6.4 Advanced monitoring/CloudWatch strategies

## IV. 🧠 Inferred Interests from Behavior and Practice

- **Permission Debugging Mastery**  
  Your persistent IAM troubleshooting and “debug-with-AI” workflow shows an inclination to solve permission puzzles and architect secure flows.

- **Hands-On, Experiment-Driven Learning**  
  You favor running, breaking, and fixing real AWS resources (not just reading), blending CLI, console, and scripts in a hybrid operational model.

- **Cost and Resource Mindfulness**  
  Strong attention to cleaning up, budgeting, and safe experimentation—typical of an engineer managing both practical deployments and personal spend.

- **Documentation and Mapping**  
  Your regular use of architectural roadmaps, causality tables, and session logs reveals a system-level mindset—prioritizing clarity and traceability.

- **DevOps Mindset**  
  You strategically combine manual oversight with scripting/automation (Python, bash, boto3), reflecting a hybrid DevOps approach tailored for robust cloud operations.

- **API Security & Integration Awareness**  
  Demonstrated active integration of JWT/Cognito-based API security practices into your architecture, highlighting security-awareness at every operational layer.

## V. 🌐 Embedded & Automotive Context Integration

- **IoT & Cloud-Edge Integration**: Aligning AWS services (like Lambda, IoT Core, and EC2) with embedded software (Automotive control units, data logging, telemetry) as future exploration zones.

---

## ✅ Final Note

You have already internalized many core concepts from IAM, Lambda, S3, EC2, and CodeBuild.  
Your most productive learning zone now lies in **full CI/CD automation, deep IAM design, and moving toward Infrastructure as Code** for reusable, scalable AWS projects—while also exploring the connection between cloud and embedded/automotive domains.
